  - HPC Images

2. Install driver manually
  - Regular Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

How to check whether infiniband is installed and working?

1. Check deivce is detected

  lspci | grep Mellanox
  02:00.0 Network controller: Mellanox Technologies MT27500 Family [ConnectX-3]

2. Using ibstat (if driver & support module is installed/loaded properly)

    $ ibstat
    CA 'mlx4_0'
            CA type: MT4100
            Number of ports: 1
            Firmware version: 2.43.7008
            Hardware version: 0
            Node GUID: 0x00155dfffe33ff0c
            System image GUID: 0x506b4b03004f9753
            Port 1:
                    State: Active
                    Physical state: LinkUp
                    Rate: 40
                    Base lid: 46
                    LMC: 0
                    SM lid: 2
                    Capability mask: 0x00010000
                    Port GUID: 0x00155dfffd33ff0c
                    Link layer: InfiniBand

   If there's no output from ibstat, something is wrong such as HW node fault, SW driver loading faulure, etc.

3. Run ifconfig

    ib0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 2044
            inet 172.16.1.3  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.16.255.255
            inet6 fe80::215:5dff:fd33:ff0c  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
            unspec 00-01-46-CE-FE-80-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 256  (UNSPEC)
            RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
            RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 12  bytes 928 (928.0 B)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

   If there's no ib0 from output of ifconfig, please check openibd is working.

4. Unfortunately, other testing tools like ibhosts, iblinkinfo, etc were not ran as expected.

Tested Solutions (it's working):

1. Intel MPI
2. OpenMPI
3. Tensorflow
4. Pytorch
5. Horovod (Combination of above solutions)
